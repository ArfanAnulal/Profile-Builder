# **Profile Builder - A Flutter Learning Project**

A simple and elegant Flutter application that allows users to create a personal profile card. This project was built by a second-year Computer Science student as a focused challenge to learn the fundamentals of the Flutter framework in under a week.


## **üì∏ Screenshots & Demo**

A picture is worth a thousand lines of code. Here is a quick demonstration of the app in action.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Packages Used**



* **Core:** Flutter, Dart
* **Packages:**
    * image_picker: For selecting images from the device gallery.


## **üå± My Learning Journey**

As a second-year CS student with a background in the MERN stack, I challenged myself to learn mobile development. This project is the tangible result of that focused effort. Through building the Profile Builder, I gained practical experience with:



* The fundamentals of Flutter's widget-based UI system, including StatefulWidget for managing local state.
* Handling user input and validation effectively using TextFormField and a GlobalKey&lt;FormState>.
* Integrating and utilizing third-party packages from pub.dev.
* Structuring a Flutter application into logical components with separate files.
* Basic navigation between screens using Navigator.push.


## **üöÄ Project Evolution**

This project wasn't built in a single day. It represents a rapid learning path over my first week with Flutter:



* **Day 2: The First Step:** My journey began with a simple "Background Color Changer" app. This taught me the absolute basics of Flutter, including StatelessWidget, StatefulWidget, and how to use setState().
* **Day 4: Building the Skeleton:** I then created a hardcoded version of this Profile Builder app. This exercise was crucial for getting comfortable with Flutter's layout widgets like Column, Card, and CircleAvatar without the complexity of user input.
* **Day 6: The Full Application (This Repository):** Finally, I combined all my learnings to create this dynamic version, adding form handling and package integration to create a complete, interactive user experience.


## **üìà Future Improvements**

While this project successfully meets its initial goals, I plan to revisit it to further my learning by:



* **Refactoring State Management:** Implement a more advanced state management solution like Provider or Riverpod to manage state more efficiently.
* **Full Cross-Platform Support:** Refactor UI components and resolve any dependency issues to ensure a seamless experience on iOS.
* **Data Modeling:** Introduce a dedicated Profile data class to manage user data more cleanly and robustly.
* **Save/Share Feature:** Add functionality to save the final profile card as an image to the device gallery or share it with other apps.
